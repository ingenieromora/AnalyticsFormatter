@Description:

This API gives the user some methods to log information as a Jason Format in an easy way.
You have the capability of using Thread Local Storage to associate different log items to threads.
The user only has to instantiate a Log Item class, add to that class the attributes that he wants to be logged and print that information.
The methods in this class are thread safe and all of them are tested.
